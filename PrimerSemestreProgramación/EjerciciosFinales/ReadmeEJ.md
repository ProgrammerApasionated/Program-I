# Practise for Programming I Finals.
A directory that has all the exercises with the documentations that I will have on the real exam.

## Current content:
---
### ExamenFinal1.py :
- First examen I practise with.
- **Part 1**: Arrays and index reading — manageable.
- **Part 2**: File handling — reading a text file, extracting information, and evaluating conditions. This part was more challenging.
---
### ExamenFinal2.py :
- The second exam I revise with, I found interesting how working with different problems regarding some basic concepts can have such variety.
- **Part 1**: Manageable.
- **Part 2**: Still struggling with file‑based data processing.
---
### ExamenFinal3.py :
- The third and final exam I resolved.
- **Part 1**: Perfect.
- **Part 2**: After adding files work on this repository, I finally understand this concept.

### FUTURE IMPROVEMENT :
- Become more comfortable with the format of the exam and understand exactly what is expected  -> Working on it (50%)
- Practise more under exam-like time conditions.  -> Dealing with it (40%)
- Learn how to comment code more effectively and consistently.   -> Getting more used to it (60%)
- Work with harder file‑handling exercises.    -> Examples on `EjerciciosFicheros` (40%)
- Learn how to visualize data (e.g., analyzing school marks to detect performance patterns).   -> Reading documentation on it (10%, just started)
---
### Strategies and progress :
- I'm trying to get used to reading data that is on a text file.
- To improve this, I am creating my own datasets and problems inside `EjerciciosFicheros`, simulating exam‑like scenarios with variations.

### Examen strategy :
- After completing two exams, I noticed a clear pattern in the evaluation:
- Arrays/List  -> First exercise   File text  -> Second exercise.
- I currently (28/12/2025) find the first exercise very confortable , but I sometimes find it hard getting used to know how to iterate the variables that I work with. 
- Finally having the exam the 15/01/2026, I currently (2/01/2026) find the exam pretty easy.
