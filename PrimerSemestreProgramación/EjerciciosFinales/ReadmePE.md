# Practise for Programming I Finals.
A directory that has all the exercises with the documentations that I will have on the real exam.
## Current content:

### ExamenFinal1.py :
- First examen I practise with.
- **Part 1**: Arrays and index reading — manageable.
- **Part 2**: File handling — reading a text file, extracting information, and evaluating conditions. This part was more challenging.

### ExamenFinal2.py :
- Second examen I revise with, I found interesting how working with different problems regarding some basics concepts can have such variety.
- **Part 1**: Manageable.
- **Part 2**: Still struggling with file‑based data processing.

### FUTURE IMPROVEMENT :
- Become more comfortable with the format of the exam and understand exactly what is expected.  
- Practise more under exam-like time conditions.  
- Learn how to comment code more effectively and consistently.
- Work with harder file‑handling exercises.
- Learn how to visualize data (e.g., analyzing school marks to detect performance patterns).

### Strategies and progress :
- I'm trying to get used to reading data that is on a text file.
- To improve this, I am creating my own datasets and problems inside `EjerciciosFicheros`, simulating exam‑like scenarios with variations.

### Examen strategy :
- After completing two exams, I noticed a clear pattern in the evaluation:
- Arrays/List  -> First exercise   File text  -> Second exercise.
- I currently (28/12/2025) find the first exercise very confortable , but I find sometimes hard getting used to know how to iterate the variables that I work with.
