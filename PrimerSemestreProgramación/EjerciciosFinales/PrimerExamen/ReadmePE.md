A directory that has all the exercises with the documentations that I will have on the real exam.
## Current content:


### ExamenFinal1.py :
- First examen I practise with, the first problem was manageable but the second one caused more trouble.
- The first part deals with arrays and reading indices correctly.
- Second part is regarding files: reading a file and extracting information and evaluating a condition.



### FUTURE IMPROVEMENT :
- Become more comfortable with the format of the exam and understand exactly what is expected.  
- Practise more under exam-like time constraints.  
- Learn how to comment code more effectively and consistently.
