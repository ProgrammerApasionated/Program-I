# Practise for Programming I Finals.
A directory that has some exercises regarding core concepts from Python.

## Current content:

### calculos_lluvias.py :
- An algorithm that, given an array of rainfall quantities, performs several operations.
- These operations include: detecting streaks of days without rain, finding the maximum rainfall, and finding the minimum.
### calculos_temperaturas.py
- Similar to **calculos_lluvias.py**, but applied to temperature data.
- Includes operations such as: average temperature, maximum and minimum values, streaks of negative temperatures, and modifying a specific index.

### FUTURE IMPROVEMENT :
- Add an interactive menu so the program can be used by a regular user.
- Expand these concepts with more complex operations.
- Redirect the output or results to a text file.
