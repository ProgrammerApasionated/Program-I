# Practise for Programming I Finals.
A directory that has some practise projects regarding strings and arrays.

## Current content:

### manipulaciones_cadenas.py :
- Big difference with other projects by adding some methods that are very useful.
- With some functions that manipulate strings.

### manipulaciones_matrices_imagenes.py
- First practise with images and matrices, by iterating, a sum with the numbers or changing indexes.

### What I learned :
- I learned how strings work, and how different methods funcionate with strings.
- Algo how to iterate an array of an array, and some operations with them. 
- On the future (**IntroducciónClases**) I will use the methods regarding strings to evaluate conditions better.
