# Practice for Programming I Finals.
A directory that has some practice projects regarding strings, arrays, dictionaries, text files and will have more.

## Current content:

### manipulaciones_cadenas.py :
- Big difference with other projects by adding some methods that are very useful.
- With some functions that manipulate strings.
---
### manipulaciones_matrices_imagenes.py :
- First practice with images and matrices, by iterating, a sum with the numbers or changing indexes.
---
### manipulaciones_ficheros.py :
- First contact with an algorithm regarding text file data, more like this on `EjerciciosFicheros`.
- Just a simple file that has the idea of opening a .txt file and reading the data that has inside.
---
### manipulaciones_diccionarios.py :
- Learning an extra core concept of Python, dictionaries.
- Is a way of storing different values with a determined key (e.g. {"Blue" : 10})
- A basic exercise working with this concept.
---
### What I learned :
- I learned how strings work, and how different methods work with strings.
- Also, how to iterate over an array of arrays, and some operations with them. 
- In the future topics (**IntroducciónClases**) I will use the methods regarding strings to evaluate conditions more efficiently.
- I did not know that dictionaries were that useful. Interesting way of having data stored.
