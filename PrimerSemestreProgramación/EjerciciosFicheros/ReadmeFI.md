# EjerciciosFicheros
- Exercises focused on reading, parsing, and processing data from text files.

## Current content :

### FicheroDeportistas.py :
- Reads athlete data from `Datos.txt` using the format:  
  `Nombre ["Actividad -> Valor"] Temporada Nivel`
- Converts activities into dictionaries, shows each athlete’s sports, and calculates:
  - Highest level per sport  
  - Most practiced sports  
- Allows adding new entries to the file.

### FicheroSistemaNotas.py :
- Similar to `FicheroDeportistas.py` but applied to student data.
- Reads student data from `PruebaFicheros.txt` using the format:  
  `Nombre ["Asignatura -> Nota"] Semestre Curso`
- Shows each student’s grades, calculates best grade per subject, and computes averages.
- Demonstrates three different ways to read files in Python.

### PruebaFicheros.txt / Datos.txt :
- Own invented datasets for both programs (students and athletes).
- Data created with my ideas and with ChatGPT.

## Future improvement :
- Add interactive menus for easier user interaction.
- Export results to a new text file.
- Add sorting, filtering, and more complex analysis of the data.

## What I learned :
- How to extract structured information from text files.
- How to clean and parse complex strings.
- How to use dictionaries for analysis.
- Greater confidence with file‑based problems, essential for the exam.

## Conclusion :
These were the hardest problems that I have faced until now (28 December 2025).
- I stayed up late inventing these problems and then developing a proper solution to them.
- As I completely love data analysis, this type of work is crucial for my development as a professional.
- These were also the most satisfying work I have done in my life.
