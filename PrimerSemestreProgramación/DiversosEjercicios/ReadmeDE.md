# Practice for Programming I Finals.
A directory that has some exercises regarding core concepts from Python.
A continuation of `Calculos Diversos` but with more variety of exercises.

## Current content:

### mini_liga_fútbol.py :
- An interesting program that simulates a basic league of football with a system of victories, draws, and defeats.
- With a system of points and winning streaks.

### prueba_de_rachas.py :
- A very basic practice algorithm of streaks.

### sistema_de_notas.py :
- Similar to **sistema_de_notas_simple.py** with additional functions.
- For instance, searching a student, max or min of their grades and different methods to show the information.

### sistema_de_notas_simple.py :
- A basic system that will be improved with classes. (in `IntroducciónClasses` -> **sistema_universitario.py**)
- Based on `Calculos Diversos`, these programs demonstrate practical use of arrays.

### FUTURE IMPROVEMENT :
- Add an interactive menu that can be used by a normal user.
- Extend these concepts with more complex problems.

### What I learned with these projects :
- I was creating these files with the idea of practising for my second exam of this subject. When I finished everything I enjoyed programming as I did when I started.
- I practiced and internalized the streak algorithms, which I initially found confusing.
- I learned how to use basic indexing with arrays, some practical programs, and basic programming logic.
