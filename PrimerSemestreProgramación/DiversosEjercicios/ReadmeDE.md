# Practise for Programming I Finals.
A directory that has some exercises regarding core concepts from Python.
A continuation of **Calculos Diversos** but with more variety of exercises.

## Current content:

### mini_liga_fútbol.py :
- An interesting programa that simulate a basic league of futbol with victory, draw or defeat.
- With a sistema of points and a streak of winning games.

### prueba_de_rachas.py :
- Just a super basic practise algorithm to evaluate streaks.

### sistema_de_notas.py :
- Similar to **sistema_de_notas_simple.py** with an addition of functions.
- For example, searching a student, max or min of their grades, different methods to show the information.

### sistema_de_notas_simple.py :
- A basic sistem that will be improved with classes (in **IntroducciónClasses** -> **sistema_universitario.py**)
- With the idea of **Calculos Diversos** an idea of a way of implementing arrays to a functional use.

### FUTURE IMPROVEMENT :
- Add and interact menu that can use a normal user.
- Ampliate these conceptos with more complex operations.

### What I learned with these projects :
- I was doing this files to practise to my second examen of this subject and I enjoyed programing as I did when I started.
- And I practise the streaks algorith that I found strange at start.
- I learned how to use basic indexation with arrays, some useful normal programs, and basic programmer logic.
