# Who I am
Hi, my name is Álvaro. I'm 18 years old and currently studying Computer Engineering at UJI. I'm starting college and wanted to learn how to use Git and understand its usefulness, so I decided to create this repository as part of my learning journey.

---
## Who I am as a person
I consider myself a positive and proactive person. Doing my projects here means a lot to me because I can track my progress over time and see how I evolve.

---
## Why I started doing projects
I started doing projects to reconnect with my hobby of programming. Even if I'm not advanced yet, I want to keep learning new things and challenge myself with more complex work.

---
## What is my objective with this work
My goal is to keep my work alive and prove to myself that I can apply the theory I learn in class. In the future, I would love to collaborate with others and work as a team.

---
## My objective with this work
Of course, I want good grades, but more importantly, I want to build real projects—small solutions to real problems, or simply fun programs that reflect my passion for coding.

---
## Past experiences
- Erasmus in Turkey at age 15 (1 week).
- Futurecity: Digital Competences (DigComp 2.2 framework, intermediate and advanced levels, 83 hours).
- Programa 5UCV Gennera: innovation contest to solve real-life business problems.
- Two short courses (10 hours each): Academic Resilience and Mental Health.
- Currently participating in debate training and preparing to join the local university debate league.

---
All these experiences taught me resilience and curiosity, which I now apply to programming projects.
If you're reading this, welcome to my learning journey.

# This repository is not about having the best code, but about documenting my journey and my growth as a student.

# FirstSemesterProgramming
Personal repository documenting my technical evolution during the first semester of Computer Engineering. Here I store exercises, exam simulations, file practices, introduction to classes, and various Python manipulations. Each folder represents a specific learning phase, with its own challenges, solutions, and documentation.

##  Repository Structure

---
### `Calculos Diversos/`
- Initial exercises with arrays and basic operations (rainfall, temperature).
- Focus on logic, indices, and conditions.

---
### `DiversosEjercicios/`
- Varied programs to consolidate key concepts.
- Includes grading systems, league simulations, and streak algorithms.

---
### `EjerciciosFicheros/`
- Reading, parsing, and analyzing data from `.txt` files.
- Working with classes, dictionaries, and statistics.
- My own invented datasets to practice real-world logic.

---
### `EjerciciosFinales/`
- Exam simulations with real problems.
- Documentation of strategies, difficulties, and progress.

---
### `IntroducciónClases/`
- First contact with object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Exercises with classes, methods, and more complex structures.

---
### `ManipulacionesDiversas/`
- Practices with strings, dictionaries, files, and images.
- Focus on manipulating structures and data.

---
##  Repository Goals
- Consolidate first semester knowledge.
- Document my technical and personal evolution.
- Practice under real exam conditions.
- Create a living file that reflects my way of learning and problem-solving.

---
##  What it Represents
This repository is not just a collection of exercises. It is a display of persistence, curiosity, and progression. Each script, README, and commit is part of my technical, emotional, and symbolic record as a developing programmer with its own challenges, solutions, and reflective documentation.

---
##  Next Steps
- Add visualizations and result exports.
- Integrate interactive menus in programs.
- Consolidate the use of classes and advanced structures.
- Organizing a more complex portfolio.
