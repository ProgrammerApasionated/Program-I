# FirstSemesterProgramming
Personal repository documenting my technical evolution during the first semester of Computer Engineering. Here I store exercises, exam simulations, file practices, introduction to classes, and various Python manipulations. Each folder represents a specific learning phase, with its own challenges, solutions, and documentation.

##  Repository Structure

---
### `Calculos Diversos/`
- Initial exercises with arrays and basic operations (rainfall, temperature).
- Focus on logic, indices, and conditions.

---
### `DiversosEjercicios/`
- Varied programs to consolidate key concepts.
- Includes grading systems, league simulations, and streak algorithms.

---
### `EjerciciosFicheros/`
- Reading, parsing, and analyzing data from `.txt` files.
- Working with classes, dictionaries, and statistics.
- My own invented datasets to practice real-world logic.

---
### `EjerciciosFinales/`
- Exam simulations with real problems.
- Documentation of strategies, difficulties, and progress.

---
### `IntroducciónClases/`
- First contact with object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Exercises with classes, methods, and more complex structures.

---
### `ManipulacionesDiversas/`
- Practices with strings, dictionaries, files, and images.
- Focus on manipulating structures and data.

---
##  Repository Goals
- Consolidate first semester knowledge.
- Document my technical and personal evolution.
- Practice under real exam conditions.
- Create a living file that reflects my way of learning and problem-solving.

##  What it Represents
This repository is not just a collection of exercises. It is a display of persistence, curiosity, and progression. Each script, README, and commit is part of my technical, emotional, and symbolic record as a developing programmer with its own challenges, solutions, and reflective documentation.

##  Next Steps
- Add visualizations and result exports.
- Integrate interactive menus in programs.
- Consolidate the use of classes and advanced structures.
- Organizing a more complex portfolio.
