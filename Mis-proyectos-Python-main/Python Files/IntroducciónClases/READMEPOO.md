### First steps with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
### My first projects with this orientation, focused on practicing basic concepts without chasing optimization nor perfect results.
With the theory of my Programming I class on computer engineering at UJI.
## Current content :
### introduccion_POO.py
- Best grade, average grade, show info of a student, create a student and update student information.  
- Future mindset: interactive menu, additional class to manage a list of students.  

### ejercicio_biblioteca.py
- Interactive menu with methods such as creating a book, searching, lending, returning, or adding new books.  
- Focused on consolidating core concepts: class interactions, menu creation, and exploring advanced debugging techniques.
### FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
### introduccion_POO.py :
Future optimizations, such as, an interactive menu or creating another class that has a list with students.
### ejercicio_biblioteca.py :
Consolidating core concepts, like interactions with classes, creating an interactive menu or learning more advanced debugging systems.
