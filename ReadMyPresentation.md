# Who I am
Hi, my name is Álvaro. I'm 18 years old and currently studying Computer Engineering at UJI. I'm starting college and wanted to learn how to use Git and understand its usefulness, so I decided to create this repository as part of my learning journey.

## Who I am as a person
I consider myself a positive and proactive person. Doing my projects here means a lot to me because I can track my progress over time and see how I evolve.

---
## Why I started doing projects
I started doing projects to reconnect with my hobby of programming. Even if I'm not advanced yet, I want to keep learning new things and challenge myself with more complex work.

---
## What is my objective with this work
My goal is to keep my work alive and prove to myself that I can apply the theory I learn in class. In the future, I would love to collaborate with others and work as a team.

---
## My objective with this work
Of course, I want good grades, but more importantly, I want to build real projects—small solutions to real problems, or simply fun programs that reflect my passion for coding.

## Past experiences
- Erasmus in Turkey at age 15 (1 week).
- Futurecity: Digital Competences (DigComp 2.2 framework, intermediate and advanced levels, 83 hours).
- Programa 5UCV Gennera: innovation contest to solve real-life business problems.
- Two short courses (10 hours each): Academic Resilience and Mental Health.
- Currently participating in debate training and preparing to join the local university debate league.

All these experiences taught me resilience and curiosity, which I now apply to programming projects.
If you're reading this, welcome to my learning journey.

# This repository is not about having the best code, but about documenting my journey and my growth as a student.
